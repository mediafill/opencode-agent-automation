# Production-Ready Code Examples

This directory contains **examples** of production-ready code generated by the OpenCode Agent Automation system.

⚠️ **Note**: These are **demonstration examples** showing what the automation system can produce. Our automation tool itself doesn't use these files - they're samples of code that OpenCode agents generated when given development tasks.

## What These Examples Show

These examples demonstrate the quality and sophistication of code that OpenCode agents can generate when delegated common development tasks:

- **Error handling and logging** - Comprehensive structured logging and error management
- **Security implementations** - Rate limiting, input validation, security headers  
- **Testing strategies** - Complete Jest testing framework setup
- **Production patterns** - Health checks, graceful shutdown, monitoring

## Usage

- **Copy and adapt** these patterns for your own projects
- **Reference them** when delegating similar tasks to OpenCode agents
- **Show stakeholders** the quality of automated code generation

## Examples Available

- `logger.js` - Comprehensive structured logging system with Winston
- `error-handler.js` - Production-grade error handling patterns  
- `jest.config.js` - Testing framework configuration for comprehensive coverage

## Generated By

These examples were created by delegating this objective to OpenCode agents:
```bash
.claude/launch.sh delegate "add robust error handling and structured logging throughout application"
```

Starting with a simple 25-line Express.js app, the agents generated 500+ lines of production-ready code with comprehensive security, monitoring, and error handling - all working in parallel.

## Not Part of This Repository

These examples demonstrate **output** from the automation system. The automation system itself consists of:
- Python delegation scripts (`scripts/delegate.py`)
- Bash agent runners (`scripts/run_agents.sh`)  
- Monitoring tools (`scripts/monitor.sh`)
- Integration guides (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
