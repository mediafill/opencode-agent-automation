# OpenCode Agent Automation System

🤖 **Automated AI agent delegation system for Claude and OpenCode integration**

Transform your development workflow with intelligent AI agents that work autonomously on your codebase.

## Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Task Detection** - Analyzes your project and generates appropriate tasks
- 🔄 **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple OpenCode agents concurrently
- 📊 **Progress Monitoring** - Real-time status and logging
- 🎯 **Smart Delegation** - Intelligently assigns tasks based on project context
- 🔧 **Easy Integration** - Works with any project type
- 📦 **No Dependencies** - Uses OpenCode's built-in capabilities

## Quick Install

### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediafill/opencode-agent-automation/main/install.sh | bash
```

### NPM install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-agent-automation
```

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediafill/opencode-agent-automation
cd opencode-agent-automation
bash install.sh
```

## Prerequisites

- **OpenCode** - Install from [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai)
- **Python 3.7+** - For task delegation script
- **Bash** - For shell scripts

Optional:
- **Claude CLI** - For enhanced integration
- **Node.js** - For NPM installation

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After installation, use the `agents` command in your project:

```bash
# Start all agents with default tasks
agents start

# Check agent status
agents status

# Stop all agents
agents stop

# View logs
agents logs

# Delegate specific objective
agents delegate "make the application production ready"
```

### Project Setup

1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediafill/opencode-agent-automation/main/install.sh | bash
   ```
3. The installer will create a `.claude` directory with all necessary files

### Configuration

Edit `.claude/config.env` to customize:

```bash
# Maximum concurrent agents
MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=4

# Agent timeout (seconds)
AGENT_TIMEOUT=900

# Auto restart failed agents
AUTO_RESTART=true

# OpenCode model selection
OPENCODE_MODEL="default"
```

### Task Definition

Create custom tasks in `.claude/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "security_audit",
      "type": "security",
      "priority": "high",
      "description": "Audit code for security vulnerabilities",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "add_tests",
      "type": "testing",
      "priority": "medium",
      "description": "Add unit tests for core functions",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Examples

### Production-Ready Code Generation

The `examples/` directory contains **sample code** generated by the OpenCode Agent Automation system to demonstrate its capabilities. These are **not part of the automation tool itself**, but examples of what it can produce.

Starting with this simple objective:
```bash
agents delegate "add robust error handling and structured logging throughout application"
```

**The automation system generated:**
- 🛡️ **Comprehensive security middleware** with rate limiting and input validation  
- 📊 **Structured logging system** with correlation IDs and multiple log levels
- ⚡ **Production-grade error handling** with graceful degradation
- 🔍 **System health monitoring** with memory and uptime tracking
- 🧪 **Complete testing framework** with Jest and coverage reporting

### Real-World Results

**Input:** Basic 25-line Express.js app  
**Output:** 500+ lines of production-ready code with enterprise-grade features

All generated automatically by multiple OpenCode agents working in parallel, demonstrating the power of the automation system for real development projects.

### Production Readiness

Make your application production-ready:

```bash
agents delegate "make the application production ready with security, testing, and monitoring"
```

This will automatically:
- Audit security vulnerabilities
- Add rate limiting and authentication
- Create comprehensive tests
- Add monitoring and logging
- Optimize performance
- Update documentation

### Add Testing

```bash
agents delegate "add comprehensive testing with 80% coverage"
```

### Security Audit

```bash
agents delegate "perform security audit and fix vulnerabilities"
```

### Documentation

```bash
agents delegate "create API documentation and update README"
```

## How It Works

1. **Project Analysis** - Detects project type, languages, and frameworks
2. **Task Generation** - Creates appropriate tasks based on objective
3. **Agent Spawning** - Launches OpenCode agents with specific prompts
4. **Parallel Execution** - Runs multiple agents concurrently
5. **Progress Monitoring** - Tracks and logs all agent activity
6. **Result Aggregation** - Collects and reports results

## Advanced Usage

### Claude Integration

When working in projects with the automation system installed, Claude can use the comprehensive `.claude/CLAUDE.md` guide to:

- **Coordinate with OpenCode agents** for parallel task execution
- **Monitor progress** with real-time dashboards and status reporting  
- **Manage complex objectives** by breaking them into agent-executable tasks
- **Handle integration** of agent results and resolve conflicts

```bash
# Claude can delegate comprehensive objectives
agents delegate "make the application production ready with security, testing, and monitoring"

# Monitor agent progress in real-time
agents monitor watch

# Generate web dashboard for visual progress tracking
agents monitor dashboard
```

### Custom Task Delegation

```python
from opencode_agent_automation import TaskDelegator

delegator = TaskDelegator(project_dir="/path/to/project")
tasks = delegator.generate_tasks("optimize database queries")
delegator.delegate("optimize database queries", max_concurrent=8)
```

### Monitoring API

```bash
# Get JSON status
curl http://localhost:8080/agents/status

# Stream logs
curl http://localhost:8080/agents/logs
```

### WebSocket Performance Monitoring

The system includes enhanced WebSocket monitoring with real-time performance metrics:

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Connection Metrics** - Real-time uptime, message counts, and reconnection tracking
- **Performance Visualization** - Live charts showing throughput (messages/second) and latency
- **Health Indicators** - Connection reliability percentage and average response times
- **Auto-Reconnection** - Exponential backoff with intelligent retry logic (1s to 30s delays)

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Uptime and connection stability
- Messages sent/received counters  
- WebSocket latency with ping/pong measurements
- Throughput calculations (messages per second)
- Reliability scoring based on connection health

```bash
# Open the dashboard to view real-time WebSocket metrics
open http://localhost:8080/dashboard

# Monitor WebSocket performance in terminal
agents monitor websocket
```

The dashboard automatically tracks connection quality and provides visual feedback on system performance, helping identify potential issues with real-time communication.
