# CLAUDE.md Template

This file is a template. The actual CLAUDE.md integration guide is located in `/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

When the OpenCode Agent Automation system is installed, it will:

1. Check if a CLAUDE.md already exists in the project's .claude directory
2. If it exists, append the automation documentation to it
3. If it doesn't exist, copy the complete guide from `/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

This ensures that existing Claude documentation is preserved while adding the automation system capabilities.

For the complete integration guide, see: `/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
